Papercraft is a funny multiplayer browser game where you jump up platforms and try not to fall down into the flames. It uses the [Handshake Framework](https://github.com/DominikGuzei/Handshake-Js-Api) to support multiplayer gaming together with your friends, controlled by your iphones/android mobile phones or laptops in front of one screen where the game is open. All you have to do is visit the online [Papercraft Website](http://papercraft.heroku.com) and follow the instructions on screen.

How to start the game locally
--------
Papercraft is build with a simple rails application, so you just need to download the source from here, change into the app directory and press rails s. If you are not a rails developer, please visit [Ruby On Reals Official Website](http://rubyonrails.org/) to learn about this incredible useful framework ;-)

How to develop the game
---------
Currently Papercraft is built on [The Render Engine](http://renderengine.com/), a huge framework for developing games in Javascript. So you have to get used to the engine specific workflow and class structure. You will find your way if you look into the public/javascripts/papercraft/src folder, where all the files and image resources for the game are located.
